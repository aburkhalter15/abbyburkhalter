                <h3>Wayfinder Kiosk</h3>
                <p>Developing a Wayfinder kiosk was an internship opportunity that I had with working for UITS at Indiana Univeristy Kokomo. The wayfinder kiosk will be used by visitors to find people, places, or accessibility tools on campus. While the HTML and CSS are the framework that holds the wayfinder together, I used jQuery heavily for show and hide functions. The homescreen consists of three choices. A user may choose to search for people, places, or accessibility. If a user is searching for a person, they may choose people and they are sent to a list of alphabet letters. The user is told to choose the first letter of the last name of the person they are looking for. jQuery is used to show everyone who's last name begins with the chosen letter. When the user selects a name from the list presented, jQuery is used to show that person's contact information. This part was slightly more difficult because instead of simply showing something that was hidden, I pulled in a section from a completely different page. PHP is used to pull the persons that are being searched contact information from a database. </p>

                <h3>UITS Kokomo Homepage</h3>
                <p>I had the pleasure of being a part of the IU Kokomo Web Team for nearly two years during my time as a student there. While working for them I was able to gain experience working in the field of web development. I was given many projects where a page had been designed and it was my job to turn that design into code and to make it accessible. For the UITS homepage, I relatively positioned each image on the page and then absolutely position the anchor tags over them. I did this to implement a hover effect over each image.</p>

                <h3>IU Kokomo About page</h3>
                <p>During my time as a web technician on the IU Kokomo web team, I was given many projects where the goal was to take a designed web page and turn it into HTML. For the IU Kokomo about page, I had to turn a brochure into HTML. I took each row and relatively positioned them one on top of the other. Then I absolutely positioned the items inside of the rows. I followed the spacing around the text in the design very closely when I positioned each item, which is why I used absolute positioning on the items within the relatively positioned containers. I provided alternative text when it was needed for the images to make the page accessible. I also modified the design of the web page for an ipad version and a mobile version. In the responsive versions, I got rid of unnecessary images. </p>

                <h3>TWIP</h3>
                <p>Since early 2015 I have been working for a company called Foxglove Digital Information Systems. We have been developing a social network for travelers, called TWIP. The first task I was given was to make all the heading sizes on the website responsive, because the site had already been coded by someone else and the design did not have consistency. After standardizing fonts and sizes, I was then tasked with making the website responsive. We decided to use the bootstrap grid system because it is efficient. I gained a lot of experience working with bootstrap on this website and became familiar with many of the CSS classes that bootstrap uses aside from the grid system.</p>

                <h3>Liberty University Online</h3>
                <p>Liberty University Online was a small project I took on for a friend who took on too many projects at once. The code on the website was very outdated, and there were over a thousand lines of CSS. I recoded the site with HTML5, and because I reused CSS classes, I cut the amount of CSS lines from over a thousand to a little over 300 lines. The site included a small contact form, on which I used a show and hide function because it was a two step form. When the user finished filling in the first fields, they hit a next butto to show the rest of the fields of the form before submitting.</p>

                <h3>Javascript Course</h3>
                <p>I picked up very basic Javascript skills from a Javascript course I took at IU Kokomo. For this particular function, a user takes a quiz to see if they know what kind of dog is displayed in an image. I declared 5 variables, one for the quiz, two for each correct answer, and two for the outputs. I used if statements to determine the output of the function. If the user chooses akita in the first question, then the output is correct. Else if they choose anything else, the output is wrong. Same concept for the second question, only the correct answer for that one is beagle.</p>

Github is a wonderful tool for teams to use that are working on projects and are making multiple changes at a time to the same project. Contributors push their code to a repository and as long as there are no conflicts, Github merges the code. When conflicts arise, a use can go in and select which changes to implement.</p>
